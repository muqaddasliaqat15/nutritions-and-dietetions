              As you age, eating a healthy diet can help to improve<strong> mental acuteness, boost your energy

              increase your resistance to illness. Eating well can also be the key to a positive outlook and staying
              emotionally balanced.
              But healthy eating doesn’t have to be about dieting and sacrifice. Rather, it should be all about enjoying
              fresh,
              tasty food, wholesome ingredients, and eating in the company of friends and family.</p>

              The key to healthy eating is to focus on the whole, minimally processed food that your body needs as you
              age—food that is as close to its natural form as possible. Our bodies respond differently to different
              foods, depending on genetics and other health factors, so finding the healthy diet
              that works best for you may take some experimentation. These tips are a good place to start:
            </p>
            <h1 class="plenty">Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables</h1>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-8 col-lg-9 col-sm-9 col-xs-9">
                <p class="para6">Break the apple and banana rut and go for color-rich pickings like berries or melons.
                  Aim for 2-3 servings a day. When it comes to veggies, choose antioxidant-rich dark, <strong>leafy
                    greens,</strong> such as kale, spinach, and broccoli as well as <strong> Colorful vegetables
                  </strong> such as carrots and squash. Make veggies more appetizing by drizzling them with olive oil,
                  sprinkling with goat cheese, or frying with garlic or chili flakes. Try for 2-3 cups every day.</p>

            <h1 class="calcium">Choose calcium for bone health</h5>
              <p class="para7">Maintaining bone health as you age depends on adequate calcium intake to prevent
                osteoporosis and bone fractures. Good sources include <strong>milk, yogurt,cheese or non-dairy
                  sources</strong>
                such as tofu, broccoli, almonds, and kale.</p>
              <h1 class="fat">Go “good fat” not “no fat”</h5>
                <p class="para8">Rather than trying to cut out fat from your diet, focus on enjoying<strong> healthy
                    fats—such as omega-3s—</strong>that can <strong>protect your body against disease</strong>
                  and support your mood and brain function.</p>
                <h1 class="protein">Vary your sources of protein. </h5>
                  <p class="para9">As you age, eating enough high-quality protein can<strong> improve your mood, boost
                      your resistance to stress, anxiety, and depression, and even help you think more clearly.</strong>
                    However, eating too much protein from processed meat products such as hot dogs, bacon, and salami
                    may increase your risk of heart disease, cancer, and other health problems. Vary your sources of
                    protein instead of relying on
                    just red meat by including more fish, beans, peas, eggs, nuts, and seeds in your diet. </p>
                  <h1 class="fiber">Eat more fiber</h5>
                    <p class="para10">Dietary fiber can do so much more than keep you regular. It can lower your risk
                      for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, <strong>improve the health of your skin, and help you to
                        lose weight</strong>. As you age, your digestion becomes less efficient, so it’s important to
                      include enough fiber in your diet. Women over 50 should aim to eat at least 21 grams of fiber per
                      day, men over 50
                      at least 30 grams a day. Unfortunately, most of us aren’t getting even half those amounts. </p>

                            <h5>Water. </h5>
                            <p class="para11">As you get older, you may be more prone to dehydration because your sense
                              of thirst is not as sharp.
                              Remember to sip water regularly to avoid urinary tract infections, constipation, and even
                              confusion.</p>

                            <h5>Vitamin B</h5>
                            <p class="para12">After the age of 50, your stomach produces less gastric acid making it
                              harder to absorb vitamin B-12—needed to help keep blood and nerves healthy.
                              Get the recommended daily intake (2.4 mcg) of B12 from fortified foods or a vitamin
                              supplement.</p>
                            <h5>Vitamin D.</h5>
                            <p class="para13">With age, your skin is less efficient at synthesizing vitamin D, so
                              consult your doctor about supplementing your diet
                              with fortified foods or a multivitamin, especially if you’re obese or have limited sun

                      <p class="para6">Every year over the age of 40, our metabolism slows, and often we become less physically
                        active.
                        This makes it even more important to adopt healthy eating and exercise habits to avoid weight gain.</p>

              <h1 class="senses">Weakened senses:</h1>
              <p class="para3">Older adults tend to lose sensitivity to salty and bitter tastes first, so you may be
                inclined to salt your food more heavily than before—even though older adults need less salt than younger
                people.
                Use herbs, spices, and healthy oils—like olive oil—to season food instead of salt.</p>
              <h1 class="illness">Medications and illness:</h5>
                <p class="para4">Some health problems or medications can negatively influence appetite or affect taste,
                  again leading older adults to consume too much sugar or salt. Talk to your doctor.</p>
                <h1 class="digest">Digestion</h1>
                <p class="para4">Due to a slowing digestive system, you generate less saliva and stomach acid as you get
                  older, making it more difficult for your body to process certain vitamins and minerals, such as B12,
                  B6 and folic acid, which are necessary to maintain mental alertness and good circulation.
                  Up your fiber intake and talk to your doctor about possible supplements.</p>
